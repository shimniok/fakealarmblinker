A fake car alarm blinker circuit based on the venerable 555 timer in astable mode.

In the schematic I set up a frequency and duty cycle that I personally prefer
(around 1-2Hz, 80% OFF / 20% ON duty cycle (555 is sinking current from LED)
but you can easily change the R1/R2/C1 values using various 555 timer calculators
like [this one](http://www.ohmslawcalculator.com/555-astable-calculator)

The project is designed to fit into a Hammond 1555Q box [[pdf](http://www.hammondmfg.com/pdf/1551PFL.pdf)] which is a small flanged-mount box, so it'll be easy to install into your vehicle.
